Experiment No.11

Write a code in JAVA for a simple Word Count application that counts the number of occurrences
of each word in a given input set using the Hadoop Map-Reduce framework on local-standalone
set-up.
Step 1) mkdir words
Step 2) Download hadoop-core-1.2.1.jar, which is used to compile and execute the MapReduce
program. Visit the following
link
http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-core/1.2.1
Step 3) Put that downloaded jar file into words folder.
Step 4) Implement WordCount.java program.
Step 5) Create input1.txt on home directory with some random text
Step 6) go on words path then compile
javac -classpath /home/vijay/words/hadoop-core-1.2.1.jar /home/vijay/words/WordCount.java
Step 7) jar -cvf words.jar -c words/ .
Step 8) cd .. then use following commands
hadoop fs -mkdir /input
hadoop fs -put input1.txt /input
hadoop fs -ls /input
hadoop jar /home/vijay/words/words12.jar WordCount /input/input1.txt /out321
hadoop fs -ls /out321
hadoop fs -cat /out321/part-r-00000
